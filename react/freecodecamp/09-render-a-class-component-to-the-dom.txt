/* React components are passed into ReactDOM.render() a little differently than JSX elements.
* For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render.
* However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component,
* for example ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode).
* You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.
